# Ignore the lru unsound advisory - it comes from near-vm-runner which is
# locked to lru ^0.12.3 and cannot be updated to the fixed 0.16.3 version.
# The advisory relates to IterMut's Stacked Borrows violation, which does
# not affect our usage as we don't use IterMut directly.
# Tracked: https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues/XXXXX (upstream)
