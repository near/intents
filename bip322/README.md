# BIP-322 Bitcoin Message Signature Verification

A production-ready implementation of [BIP-322](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0322.mediawiki) "Generic Signed Message Format" for the NEAR blockchain ecosystem.

## üéØ Purpose

This module provides **complete BIP-322 signature verification** for Bitcoin messages, enabling NEAR smart contracts to validate signatures created by Bitcoin wallets. It supports both "Simple" and "Full" BIP-322 signature formats across all major Bitcoin address types.

### Key Features

- **üõ°Ô∏è Production Ready**: Zero-dependency cryptography using only NEAR SDK host functions
- **üìã Wide Coverage**: Supports most major Bitcoin address types (P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH, P2WSH)
- **‚ö° Gas Optimized**: Minimal gas consumption through efficient NEAR SDK integration
- **üîí Security Focused**: Comprehensive validation with proper error handling
- **üß™ Well Tested**: Extensive test suite with official BIP-322 reference vectors

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

- **`lib.rs`**: Main `SignedBip322Payload` struct with `Payload` and `SignedPayload` trait implementations
- **`signature.rs`**: BIP-322 signature parsing and verification logic
- **`bitcoin_minimal.rs`**: Minimal Bitcoin types optimized for BIP-322 (transactions, addresses, scripts)
- **`hashing.rs`**: BIP-322 message hash computation with proper tagged hashing
- **`transaction.rs`**: BIP-322 "to_spend" and "to_sign" transaction construction
- **`verification.rs`**: Address validation and public key recovery logic

### Dependencies

```toml
# Cryptography: NEAR SDK host functions only
defuse-crypto = { workspace = true }
near-sdk = { workspace = true }
defuse-near-utils = { workspace = true, features = ["digest"] }

# Address parsing: Minimal external dependencies
bs58 = "0.5"      # Base58Check encoding for legacy addresses
bech32 = "0.11"   # Bech32 encoding for segwit addresses
base64 = "0.22"   # Base64 signature decoding
```

## üöÄ Usage

```rust
use defuse_bip322::SignedBip322Payload;
use defuse_crypto::SignedPayload;

// Parse and verify a BIP-322 signature
let payload = SignedBip322Payload {
    address: "bc1q9vza2e8x573nczrlzms0wvx3gsqjx7vavgkx0l".parse()?,
    message: "Hello Bitcoin!".to_string(),
    signature: "AkcwRAIgeGl4sSPd7zEIvhxdN8GgP4vgSqA8TdyPMeIpCF4gqgE4AiBsjQd0D1OFxdnHQPNOI1YdGlBD6kEOGRnHhcAkHnxUcAH=".parse()?,
};

// Verify signature and extract public key
if let Some(public_key) = payload.verify() {
    println!("‚úÖ Valid BIP-322 signature!");
    println!("üîë Public key: {:?}", public_key);
} else {
    println!("‚ùå Invalid signature");
}
```

## üìä Supported Features

### ‚úÖ Address Types (Mainnet Only)

| Type | Format | Example | Support |

- **Simple Signatures**: 65-byte compact format (P2PKH, P2WPKH)
- **Full Signatures**: Complete BIP-322 witness stack format (P2SH, P2WSH)
- **Automatic Detection**: Parses both formats seamlessly

### ‚úÖ BIP-322 Specification Compliance

- **Message Tagging**: Proper "BIP0322-signed-message" tagged hash computation
- **Transaction Structure**: Correct "to_spend" and "to_sign" transaction construction
- **Witness Handling**: Complete witness stack parsing and validation
- **Address Validation**: Full address format and checksum verification

## üîç Discovered Issues & Limitations

During implementation and testing, several important issues were discovered:

### 1. **P2TR (Taproot) Support - Not Implemented**

**Issue**: P2TR addresses (starting with `bc1p`) are not currently supported.

**Details**: 
- P2TR uses Taproot (BIP-341) with different signature schemes
- Requires Schnorr signature verification instead of ECDSA
- NEAR SDK currently only provides ECDSA `ecrecover` host function
- Would require significant additional cryptographic implementation

**Workaround**: The module explicitly validates against Taproot addresses and returns clear error messages.

### 2. **Compressed Public Key Handling - Partial Implementation**

**Issue**: The current API expects uncompressed 64-byte public keys, but Bitcoin commonly uses compressed 33-byte keys.

**Details**:
- NEAR SDK `ecrecover` returns 64-byte uncompressed keys
- Bitcoin witness stacks often contain 33-byte compressed keys  
- The module validates compressed keys correctly but cannot decompress them. Implementation of the decompression
inside contract is computationally intensive (i.e. gas hungry). Existing SDK API does not provide a way to uncompress keys.
- See TODO at `bip322/src/signature.rs:384`

**Current Behavior**: 
- Compressed key validation works correctly
- Returns placeholder `[0u8; 64]` array to indicate successful validation
- Actual compressed key data is discarded

**Future Solution**: Update the API to handle both compressed and uncompressed keys natively.

### 3. **Invalid Test Vector - Unisat Wallet Issue**

**Issue**: A test vector generated by Unisat wallet fails verification.

**Test Vector**:
```rust
ADDRESS = "bc1qyt6gau643sm52hvej4n4qr34h3878ahs209s27"
MESSAGE = '{"signer_id":"alice.near","verifying_contract":"defuse.near","deadline":"Never","nonce":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=","test":"value"}'
SIGNATURE = "H6Gjb7ArwmAtbS7urzjT1IS+GfGLhz5XgSvu2c863K0+RcxgOFDoD7Uo+Z44CK7NcCLY1tc9eeudsYlM2zCNYDU="
```

**Investigation Results** (see validation scripts):
1. **Python Verification**: External Bitcoin libraries confirm the signature does not verify
2. **Multiple Hash Attempts**: Tested both Bitcoin message signing and BIP-322 hashing - neither produces a matching public key
3. **Address Mismatch**: The recovered public key does not correspond to the given address

**Evidence**: See `unisat-failure.png` - screenshot showing verification failure on the bip322.org reference implementation.

**Conclusion**: The test vector appears to be invalid, possibly due to:
- Incorrect signature generation by the wallet
- Wrong message format during signing
- Copy/paste errors in the test vector

**Current Status**: Test is marked as `#[ignore]` and documented as expecting failure.

## üß™ Testing

The module includes comprehensive testing:

- **Unit Tests**: Address parsing, message hashing, transaction building
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end signature verification workflows
